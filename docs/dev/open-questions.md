# Open questions

Topics raised in design discussions that are not decided yet. When one is
decided, record it in an ADR or design doc and remove it from this list. Each
item notes when it must be settled.

## Needs a dedicated discussion

- **UI of each later feature** (before building it). The M2 UI is decided
  ([`ui.md`](ui.md), [ADR 0026](adr/0026-m2-ui-layout.md)); M3 and later
  features (avy, ripgrep results, the menu contents, the git status buffer,
  the terminal) are designed when they come up.

## M1

- `ttf-parser` is unmaintained (RUSTSEC-2026-0192, ignored in `deny.toml`).
  It comes from winit's Wayland decorations. Re-check when winit is
  upgraded.

## M3

- Initial set of tree-sitter grammars, beyond Rust, Markdown and TOML.
- Fuzzing targets and how long they run.
- URL-opening policy: which schemes, and what confirmation.
- Migemo dictionary source and licensing. Common dictionaries derive from GPL
  SKK dictionaries and cannot be bundled under MIT OR Apache-2.0
  ([ADR 0020](adr/0020-license.md)). Options: the user supplies the
  dictionary, a permissively licensed dictionary, or generating one from
  permissive data.

## M4

- Claude Code hooks: which events map to which states, and how
  `oso integration install claude` merges with existing user settings
  ([ADR 0031](adr/0031-claude-code-integration.md)).
- Whether to add native permission dialogs (PermissionRequest hook), a
  read-only transcript viewer, or `claude -p` one-shot features later.
- OSC 7501 is a draft; track its revisions.
- Terminal: PTY implementation per OS (ConPTY on Windows) and the full list of
  allowed and blocked escape sequences.
- If oso is published with the Claude Code integration, check Anthropic's
  terms for third-party clients that launch the user's own `claude`.
- Verify that `gix` can be forced to skip `core.fsmonitor`, filters,
  textconv and external diff drivers.
- Passphrase/credential prompts via `GIT_ASKPASS`: keep the input out of
  history, the kill ring and macros.
- Exact list of git-porcelain commands to implement.

## Later

- Linux text-rendering backend: cosmic-text or FreeType + HarfBuzz.
- Exact command subsets for the directory editor and org.
- PDF engine and isolation (pdfium, a pure-Rust renderer, a separate
  process); image decoders.
- OS-level sandboxing of child processes such as language servers.
- `subsecond` hot-patching proof of concept with a plain winit app.
- Generated command reference and the Japanese edition workflow.
- Encodings other than UTF-8 (Shift_JIS, EUC-JP), when they are needed:
  detection, and conversion at the load and save boundary
  ([ADR 0022](adr/0022-text-buffer-and-file-loading.md)).
